I like how you’ve framed the **Apartment Inspection App** readme — neat sections, consistent style, a good balance of tech detail and friendliness.
Here’s a version tailored for **Kunci Hidup = Chakra Quiz App**, swapping in the right stack (Flutter + Django backend) and flavor:

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

```plaintext
lib/
├── controllers/      # GetX controllers for quiz logic & state
├── models/           # Data models (User, Quiz, ChakraResult)
├── services/         # Django API & local storage services
├── views/            # UI screens and widgets
├── utils/            # Components, themes, constants
└── main.dart         # App entry point
```

> Backend lives in a separate **Django project**, exposing REST APIs for authentication, quizzes, and results.

Would you like me to also draft the **README section for the Django backend** (API endpoints, setup, etc.) so both repos stay in sync?
